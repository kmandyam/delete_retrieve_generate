rated lower .
not personalized or warm and friendly .
so one person would eat out otherwise and dedicated for customers waiting for it .
like the size of the dance floor .
this location is always busy and use the double staff .
i love starbucks customer service at least locations for some locations .
their cheese i 'm always explain and was the quality of the broth they have used .
